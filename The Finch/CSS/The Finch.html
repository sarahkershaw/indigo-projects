  <h3>A visitor</h3>
<p id="intro1">Once in a Summer, before we met, a Summer of hot pavements, the smell of wet concrete and magnolia, there was a small finch, who came to survey the city from our fire escape.</p>

<p id="intro2">Though the finch was small, he was steady and free. The finch though was a bit out of place, why come to New York, a city where the stones have stories and the buildings hum?</p>

<p id="intro3">Wouldn't he miss the smell of earth after rain? Lakes, and the soft shade provided by trees? Wouldn't he miss his friends? All this and more?</p>

<p id="intro4">The finch assured me that he would miss earth and rain and fire and light but his visit was just a holiday. His finch friends and his finch family were curious about the city of noise and wonder so he had decided to go to see for himself, and then report back. So where should he start?</p>

<p id="dayOnea">On his first day the finch flew west, west over Chelsea, over the Highline, dotted with people. Here the finch lunched on crumbs from the tourists and sat in the sun, warming his feathers. He heard chatter in countless languages and appeared in lots of photos.</p>

<p id="dayOneb">From here, he flew a bit further west, to the narrow stretch of land between the west side highway and the Hudson river. There were narrow straits of grassy piers, with climbing frames for children to play on and fenced off areas just for dogs to run around in. The sounds here were much quieter and the finch enjoyed the river smells.</p>

<p id="dayTwoa">The next day, the finch flew south, stopping by a beautiful arch in Washington Square Park. Here the finch saw lots and lots of squirrels, more than he had ever seen in his life. He also saw some red-tailed hawks soaring high in the sky, circling, although he decided it was safer to watch them from afar. They were considerably bigger than he was for a start, and he wasn't sure how they felt about visiting birds.</p>

<p id="dayTwob">He needn't have worried however, as the red-tailed hawks dipped and dived with lots of other birds, cardinals, pigeons, jays and all. The finch soon joined in, flying with all of the other birds, soaring high and low as the time felt right.</p>

<p id="dayTwoc">The finch kept flying south, to a bright, silver tower that glittered in the light and reflected the water that was near by. This tower was higher than those around it and could be seen from his nightly resting place on the fire escape. The finch was pleased to fly so close to it, to see his reflection in the reflective windows and to see the people working inside.</p>

<p id="dayThreea">On his third day in the city, the finch flew north, past two tall, thin silver buildings, one with pretty shoulders, the other with a large pointed top. There were people at the top of the pointed building, taking photos and looking across the city. The finch was pleased, because they could see the same view he enjoyed as he was flying around. He circled around the building twice, to see as many people as possible and see what they could see. The building was very tall, there were no trees nearby for him to rest so he flew a little further north to a large park.</p>

<p id="dayThreeb">A park! This looked a bit like his home, as there was lots grass, trees rocks and water. There were lots of people here too, some were sat on the rocks, eating their lunch. As the finch was a little bit tired from his soaring flight around the tall building, the finch flew to the ground and picked up some crumbs for lunch and to rest his wings.</p>

<p id="dayThreec">He then took a very short flight to sit by a lake. There were lots of small boats on the water and children playing. It was a bit cooler by the water and the finch enjoyed feeling the breeze ruffling his feathers. As he was sitting, quietly, he heard some animal noises, sounds he didn't recognize, quite different from the chatter of the people around him. He flew in the direction of the noises.</p>

<p id="dayThreed">The finch didn't have to fly for long, he was soon flying above a group of small buildings, painted bright colours and some trees and lakes, covered with netting. But this wasn't the most interesting part to the finch, no, the most interesting part was the many animals the finch could see. Animals of all shapes and sizes, animals he had never seen before.</p>

<p id="dayThreee">For starters there was a large white bear, walking slowly on all-fours, before jumping into the water. The bear was huge, much bigger than even the tallest people the finch had ever seen. He had big fluffy paws, hiding long, sharp claws. The finch was a bit scared by this bear but liked to look at him all the same.</p>

<p id="dayThreef">Next the finch flew to where several large white and black snow leopards were, the snow leopards were still a bit intimidating for the finch, but he loved watching them gracefully leap from tree to rock and back again. They had long tails that stuck out behind them when they were jumping, helping the snow leopards balance.</p>

<p id="dayThreeg">The finch could also see and hear a more familiar creature, birds, lots of them, some he had seen before, some he had not. All of the birds were very chatty, telling the finch about their day, their families, the people that come to visit them and much, much more. This familiar chatter soothed the finch, making him miss his friends and family at home, gathered under the cedar trees. How much he would have to tell them when he got back!</p>

<p id="dayThreeh">The finch thought about all he had seen, the people, the lunch crumbs, the waterways, the large, silver buildings, the playgrounds, the animals and the trees.</p>

<p id="dayThreei">Suddenly, after thinking about all he had seen, the finch felt tired. Terribly, terribly tired! The finch decided to make the short flight back to the fire escape, to curl up, placing his beak under his wing and going to sleep. The humans on the other side of the fire escape had left him some bird seed in a feeder, so the naughty grey squirrels couldn't sneak up and steal it, so the finch had a ready-made supper awaiting him when he got to the fire escape. He was so grateful and felt kindly towards the humans and their small, nosy dog with rust-coloured fur.</p>
