<h3> Experience </h3>
	<h4>Freelance WebmasterMarketing Consultant</h4>
	<h6>June 2014 – Present </h6>
	<p>
		Working on a freelance basis helping clients either improve their existing websites or building new sites.   In the majority of cases, once the site has been improved to the client's satisfaction, I work with the client to develop a marketing plan, usually with a focus on creating content.   Other projects so far include implementing CRO tests using Optimizely, advising on metadata tags and upgrading the e-commerce platform.
	</p>

	<h4>SEO Analyst, <a href="http://distilled.net">Distilled</a></h4>
	<h6>February 2013 – June 2014 </h6>
	<p>
	Consultant for variety of companies, advising on search engine optimisation (SEO) best practices and applying this insight to broader marketing initiatives to maximise ROI. This involved technical audits, to diagnose site problems and working with the developers to implement these improvements.  Beyond my consulting responsibilities I wrote and edited the monthly newsletter summarising the latest developments in search.
